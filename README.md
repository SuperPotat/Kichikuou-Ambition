Classes:
	In line with the economy changes from before all monster classes are being changed. General design is monsters are chonkier than other classes (higher attack defence), but the same speed ultimately.
	Made the changes to troop counts apply to starting generics too.
	M.WARRIOR:
		Vs Warrior has 10 more attack (70 vs 60).
		Vs Warrior has 5 more defence (35 vs 30).
		Speed now same as warriors.
	M.GUARD:
		Vs Guard has 5 more attack (50 vs 45).
		Vs Guard has 5 more defence (25 vs 20).
	M.ARCHER:
		Vs Archer has 5 more attack (45 vs 40).
		Vs Archer has 5 more defence (20 vs 15).
		Speed now same as archers.
	M.MAGE:
		Vs Mage has 10 more attack (45 vs 35).
		Vs Mage has 10 more defence (10 vs 0).
		Has 5 less int than normal mages (increased by 10 from last value 30 -> 40).
		Speed now same as mages.
	M.NINJA:
		New class added, exclusive to both of Kayblis' Apostles.
		Replenishment cost of 6, recruitment cost of 50.
		Vs Ninja has 2 more attack (40 vs 38).
		Vs Ninja has 5 more defence (20 vs 15).
	Civilians:
		Now have a base attack of 35 vs 33.
	Class Intelligence:
		This has been modified a bit universally.
		Mages have 45.
		Diviners and M.MAGEs have 40.
		Mikos and Brawlers have 25.
		The baseline is 15 (previous was 5). This will make diviner guard apply to all classes when they are not attacking a mage/diviner.

Damage Formula:
	Simplified the damage formula to be more readable based on changes the formula for both is down below.
	(Class_Atk/Int - Class_Def/Int*) + (Buff_Atk/Int - Buff_Def/Int) + (Unit_Atk/Int - Unit_Def/Int).
	*Seemed to have found some unused code here in the magical calculation function which factors in 'class defence' against magical attacks, most of the varied effects have been removed, all that's been left is a resistance of 10 for Mage/Diviners, and 5 for M.MAGEs which will eventually share the space with spellbladers. Perhaps another will be added in here in future however. This seemed to originally want to amplify damage vs civilians for some reason, of course removed now.

Buffs:
	Removed start of turn buffs from tacticians and related sources (field tactician skill, black general, etc.).
	Removed speed buffs from most general sources (battle strategy and related are getting decomissioned).
	Buffed tactician's speed by 5 (down from 20, equal with archers now).
	Buff Power:
		Buff power is now decided by the skill used, not the individual's stats.
		Buffs will be based off of how much stats give to units, rather than stats + class, for example the average stat is 6, which is equal to 30 attack, and 24 defence.
		The upper range for stats is 9, although very little units have a 9 in any stat, it may be better to assume 8 is effectively the 'cap' for these calculations. It is similar on the inverse, where stats like 1, 2, 3 aren't conventionally hit by units, 4 being the usual minimum for an 'actual' stat. This sets the range for attack as 20-40 and defence as 16-32, which is what the modifiers will be based around.
		Defence always gives 80% of the amount of stats attack gives in terms of stats to intend that most units won't hit damage minimums combined with low defence scores.
		The multiplication of the effect of buffs they give to defence must take part in the calculation, not at the moment which a unit gets buffs due to int calculating for attack and defence, it is possible to split the int stat into 2, or some other crazy purpose like int attack going on the attack stat but this would ruin lots of units or overcomplicate the game for little reason.
		Scale:
			Miserable effect will give 2. Pretty irrelevant.
			Small effect will give 5. This will give on average a 33% increase in stats based bonuses (in the case of warriors this will over all increase calculations by 6% and 9%).
			Medium effect (which can buff 3 on column skills and anywhere from 0-6 on other skills) will give 10. This will give on average a 33% increase in stats based bonuses (in the case of warriors this will over all increase calculations by 11% and 15%).
			High effect (can buff 2 units at once) will give 15. This will give on average a 66% increase in stats based bonuses (in the case of warriors this will over all increase calculations by 17% and 22%).
			Very High effect will give 20.
			Ridiculous effect will give 25.
		Another interpretation can be to switch the buffs from affecting unit stats to affecting class stats. This would work theoretically for attack stats, but would fail on defense stats due to how the calculation works and some units effectively having 0 defence (getting no bonuses from buffs) and fails to address int modifiers properly, with most classes having a 5.

Troops:
	Removed the buildings which give you troops based off of class at turn start.

Generic Generation:
	Changed generics to pull from the following classes at equal weight:
		Warriors, Guards, Archers, Ninjas, Brawlers, Healers, Tacticians, faction exclusive
		You will still get a guaranteed tactician if you have none, and guaranteed guards if you have less than 2.
		Faction Exclusive units are rolled at equal weighting to the following and are:
			Leazas - Knights
			Ex Rebels - Tacticians
			AL Church - Healers
			NIPPON - Ninjas

			Zeth - Mages
			Rance Thieves - Animals
			Pencilcow - Diviners
			The O/Red - Hannys
			Custom/Portugal - Cannons
			Shangri-La - Cavalry

	Misc:
		Generics now all have a battlefield survival probability, was previously 50% chance to be 0% outside of Leazas, and 100% chance to be 0% on monster factions.

Misc Skills:
	Full Power Warrior Attack now deals 2x damage and gets 2x counterattack damage (previously 1.5x and 2x).
	Full Power Warrior Attack 2 now deals 3x damage and gets 2.5x counterattack damage (previously 2x and 2x)

Damage Formula:

	Formula for def is now (DEF * 4) + buff/2.

	Buffs known to be slightly overpowering with this formula, will adjust the strength of buffs all together.

Misc:
	Changed all mentions of 'Rance' the 'gains respect for Rance'/etc. messages to 'the commander'.

Changelog:
	Notes for future versions now in a separate file (I didn't intend for it to remain for so long).
	Universal mechanic changes with adding delay after prep and restoring from 0 actions removed, can slightly confirm the after prep moves works, but not the restoring from 0 actions.

1. Unit Changes
	Leazas:
		Lia Parapara Leazas - 4/4/3/5/4 -> 3/4/3/5/3, 'Electroshock' Removed (Nerf, Was going to give her a normal one rather than scaling but apparently on the same move, so I'll just remove?)
		Maris Amaryllis - 4/5/4/7/5 -> 3/6/6/6/4, Miko Storm 2 -> 1 (slight nerf while buffing her defence)
		Rick Addison - 4/8/7/6/7 -> 4/8/6/5/7 (Slight def nerf but still bulky)
		Kentou Kanami - 'Sonic Shuriken' -> Sonic Shuriken (Why she had a unique sonic shuriken idk, was semi-OP)
		Leila Grecni - 5/7/7/7/6 -> 4/7/7/7/6
		Cordoba Burn - 3/2/9/4/3 -> 2/3/9/2/3 (Major nerf, mainly to his int defence, does not last well in longer fights)
		Kinkaid Brambla - 5/3/4/2/5 -> 4/5/5/4/5 (Made an average unit, why was he so weak?)
		Menad Shisei - 4/7/6/5/5 -> 5/7/5/5/6 (Slight change to differenciate herself)
		Julia - 3/3/2/2/2 -> 3/3/4/3/3
		Aviator Sukatto - 4/4/5/8/6 -> 3/3/4/7/5 (Older instructor, why does she have 8 int? Already have Barres greedy)

	Ex Rebellion:
		Ex Banquet - 4/6/6/8/5 -> 5/5/5/9/6, Status Cancel II -> III (Heavy buff, meant to be best tactician in the game, a bit more frail however)
		Haurein Province - 5/5/6/5/7 -> 4/7/6/7/6, Battle Tactics (ALL) -> Battle Rating Up 1 (Large buff and role change, battle rating up being vastly more useful than all buffs, and upgradeable, tactician removed too which is a +)
		Pegasus Fort - 4/3/4/5/3 -> 3/4/5/6/4 (A worse barres, 1 stat less in every department aside from Int, which is 2 lower and battle tactics 1 instead of 2)
		Dodge Evans - 3/4/6/3/4 -> 2/5/7/7/3, Instant Advantage -> Enhanced Initial Guard (Comparable to Cordoba, but better at tanking magic)
		Sakanaku Tenka - 3/5/4/3/5 -> 2/5/5/5/5, Battle Tactics (Single) -> Battle Tactics (All) (Guaranteed all buffs can be useful)
		Jibul Makutomi - 3/5/5/4/4 -> 3/6/6/1/6, Battle Tactics (Single) REMOVED, Roundabout charge (Just a normal kinda warrior)
		Rafalia Musca - 4/6/5/7/6 -> 1/5/5/7/6, Tactician -> Musket, Bow attack -> Aim and Shoot, Loses battle tactics, Status Cancel I -> III, Speed luck -> Field tactician (Mixes up the faction, giving them versitility with their tactician choices)
		Yvette Cheria - 3/5/5/5/5 -> 4/6/6/6/6 (Over all buff pushes her over the edge to be good)
		Jaro Jasrack - 3/3/6/4/4 -> 3/5/6/6/5, Pillage (Fleeing warrior hunt which is useful for economy too)
		Ogier Lott Stein - 4/4/4/5/3 -> 3/7/4/5/4, Initial Battle Rating -> Initial Battleground Construction (Buff, adds to battle rating)
		Nami Horikawa - 4/3/4/6/4 -> 4/4/4/4/4 (50% buff gets her to the equivalent of 6/6/6/6 which is nice)
		Pervert Rat - 4/6/9/6/9 -> 4/6/7/6/7 (Slight nerf)

	Helman:
		Minerva - 4/8/7/9/6 -> 4/7/8/5/6 (Playing through IX she's kinda stupid so nerfed int, also made her more physically tanky rather than 'attacky')
		Lelyukov Berkov - 5/5/7/8/7 -> 4/6/7/7/6 (Very OP unit, needed the nerfs, still amazing, compared to Barres, no initial buffs and gradual units, instead getting battle rating, lower int (by 1), higher physical stats (by 1))
		Aristoles Calm - 3/4/3/6/4 -> 3/6/6/6/4 (A mirror of Ex, just worse, buffed up physical stats)
		Ruberan Zahl - 5/3/2/5/7 -> 4/4/4/5/6 (Made usable, rather than just a search bot)

		Alex Valse - Tactical Ally Guard (frontline unit)
		Cutie Band - 4/3/4/8/4 -> 3/4/5/8/4 (Makes her less melty)
		Hassam Crown - 3/4/4/6/5 -> 3/3/5/6/5, Warrior -> Guard (Comes across as more of a guard and needed some)
		Zulki Crown - 4/3/3/5/4 -> 3/4/4/5/5 (Useable)
		Meg Makibano - 2/3/6/6/3 -> 6/3/4/4/5 Advance Time -> Sleep (Makes her have actual synergy with her passive and special ability)

		Kayblis - 6/9/8/9/4 -> 6/9/8/7/4 (Slight int nerf for defence)

		Satella - 4/5/7/5/4 -> 4/6/7/7/4 (Increased stats so she's not a jobber)
		Meglass - 4/5/4/1/9 -> 3/7/6/5/8 (Odd stat-line, seemed to be based purely on high speed, made him a decent cav)

		Dolhan Cricket - 3/4/7/4/4 -> 2/4/7/4/4 (Debateably a buff, as due to no commander fights no real way to get action books, after using barrier ally guard one is forced to wait or ally avenger on his next turn, ally avenger has no synergy with his kit)
		Seigan - 4/7/7/8/7 -> 3/6/6/7/6 (Nerf, devil's scythe is crazy strong)
		Suzume - 4/7/6/5/7 -> 4/6/5/5/7 (Doesn't affect her main utility, just affects her ability to actually kill the back-row)

		Yuki Asakura - 4/1/3/6/5 -> 3/3/3/6/5, Recovery Rain I -> II (Too weak for the time she comes, buffed up because of that)
		Marishitten - 4/7/4/6/9 -> 3/7/4/6/7 (Slight nerf)

		Nikkou - 4/7/7/7/7, Store Power, Warrior Attack 2, Train Slash, Counterattack Rate Up 3, newly added (A monster of a unit able to deal crazy physical AoE damage and with high counterattack damage, making it tempting to deploy her alone in the front row.)
		Little Princess - 6/8/8/8/8 -> 6/6/6/6/6
		Gele - 6/9/9/9/9 -> 3/7/7/7/7, M. Mage with Fiend Slash (1.0x) and Darkness Beam (3.0x) (Prior skills removed)

	Challenge Events:
		Removed all except KD's challenge.
	Extra Random Events?:
		Removed Kanami fetish event (???).
		Removed "Meti's Question".
		Removed Child Events (spoilers + makes Rance disproportionally strong).
		Removed 'descend' event for football guy, doesn't make sense in MP.
		Removed DKR event, obvious reasons.
		Removed 'Bernards packing up', event that just screws you over.
		Removed making customs events.
	Unit Events:
		Julia & the Hanny King:
			Now only gets +4s, making her 3/7/8/7/7 after getting his blessing.
			Still gets absolute magic defence and Royal Guard Charge, making her a better Leila.
		Freak Parafin:
			Event no longer requires Redeye, instead requiring you to have both Freak and Siberia.
			Gives +4/1/1/3 for a statline of 4/6/8/7/5.
			Only doable by Patton Rebels.
		Little Princess:
			Kentarou no longer essential.
			Only doable by Hornet Faction.

3. Move Changes:
	Assassinate-'style' skills - credit to Beneblade for coding:
		Assassinate, Commander Snipe, Piercing Tempest:
			Bypass guard %, hitting a unit even if there's 100% guard in the same row.
			Deal 0.5x damage.
			Causes the attacked unit to receive 20 delay.
		Assassinate 2:
			Same as above aside from taking an action fan off of the enemy.
		Aim & Shoot:
			Deals 1.0x damage.
			Causes 10 delay to be added to the target's next action.
	S-healing:
		Healing multiplier 2.0x -> 1.5x, too much of a jump from healing 3 at 1.1x.
	Initial Battlefield Construction - credit to Beneblade for coding:
		Fixed bug where it doesn't properly apply the effect onto the enemy's battlefield effect.
		e.g. if enemy has +20% battlefield effect it now correctly becomes +15%, rather than your side having +5% and the enemy having +20%.
	'Chaotic Manuvers' - credit to Beneblade for coding:
		A new unique move for RUFFIANS.
		Applies initial battlefield construction (+5%).
		Cancels all initial guard %s, both the 50% from normal guards and the 120% from enhanced initial guard is now set to 0 at the start of the battle, a hard counter to many units.
	Bezeleye's Sword:
		Removed the weird comment from 4chan for a more straight forward description.
		Made the delay increase from 2 -> 10.
	Begone Bomb:
		5.0x -> 2.0x

4. Economy Changes:
	NP:
		Base NP is no longer 'semi-random'. Each nation now starts with 25.
		Development now gives you 2 NP, rather than 1.
		Each province's base NP has been increased, these changes vary based on the province.
		Generally this should increase the focus on economy when combined with more thourough cost changes.
	Cost: 
		Gandhi - 4 -> 3
		Karma - 2 -> 1
		Urza & Francesca - 3 -> 2
		Mi Lordling - 3 -> 2
		Lia - 1 -> 4
		
5. System Changes:
	Trading:
		Trading can now target everyone, rather than just those you're adjacent to.
	Ronin:
		Demons can now manually pull ronin like everyone else after turn 5.
		They still don't get access to start of turn ronin outside of turn 1.
	Generics:
		Raised the minimum amount of units to 16, will fill generics up to that number.
		Portugal will fill up to 17.
	Annexing:
		After turn 10 (from turn 11) all defenders will always get a castle, and all provinces will be annexed in 1 assault.
		
6. Map Changes:
	Connection from Kyoto-Oaks:
		Added to make Japan's choice of path not so 1 dimensional and open up the map.
		Costs 30 construction (+ actions).
		Can be built in either Kyoto-Oaks.
		After paying the cost, holders of both territories can attack the holder of the other.
		WARNING: Might piss off Amaterasu.
	Buildings:
		All factions aside from AL Church which start with 1 province now have 3 'buildings' in it, so require 3 action fans to annex.
