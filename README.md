A mod originally forked from Darkness Hero Rance focused on a complete multiplayer experience in the FFA gamemode in Sengoku Rance. Features a myriad of changes, large reworks for every faction, with over 100 new unique skills to differenciate units! Reworks other less obvious facets too, like the damage formula, the way the economy works making it more balanaced between factions and more! Full changes can be found in the changelog included with every release, a guide will eventually be released on a full release.

Still heavily in-dev as making large rework changes to the mod, only "Expanded Mode" is properly supported at this point in time but will eventually support all the other modes and others are planned to be included.

To install: Drag all files and over-ride them in your Sengoku Rance install folder, only supports the MangaGamer release however and will not work on the original Japanese release.
