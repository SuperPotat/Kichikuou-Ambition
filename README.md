A mod originally forked from Darkness Hero Rance focused on a complete multiplayer experience in the FFA gamemode in Sengoku Rance. Features a myriad of changes, large reworks for every faction, with over 100 new unique skills to differenciate units! Reworks other less obvious facets too, like the damage formula, the way the economy works making it more balanced between factions and more! Full changes can be found in the changelog included with every release, a guide will eventually be released on a the planned final release.

This mod is fully SFW as long as you don't open the CG menu (this'll be removed too eventually as well) and there is no NSFW content to be added at any point.

This mod is considered to be in a mostly complete state and is currently on hiatus, if any bugs are found please still report them and they will be fixed.
